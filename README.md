# Guess-the-number-game
In this game a number between 0 to 20 will automatically be selected and we need to guess that number in the input box.

If the guess is lower than the number then it says Guess is lower.

If the guess is higher than the number then it says the guess is higher. 

If the guess is correct shows correct answer.
